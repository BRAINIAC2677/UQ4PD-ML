# Beyond Accuracy: Enhancing Parkinson’s Diagnosis with Uncertainty Quantification of Machine Learning Models

## Abstract
Machine learning and deep learning models have shown significant potential in medical diagnosis, but their reliability is crucial for clinical applications. This study investigates uncertainty quantification methods to enhance model trustworthiness in Parkinson’s disease diagnosis. We evaluate Monte Carlo Dropout, Deep Evidential Classification, and Bayesian Neural Networks on three datasets capturing finger tapping, facial expressions, and speech patterns. Results show that Deep Evidential Classification underperforms in both classification accuracy and uncertainty estimation, while Monte Carlo Dropout and Bayesian Neural Networks demonstrate superior reliability. Incorporating uncertainty quantification helps identify uncertain predictions, reducing misdiagnoses and fostering safer AI integration in healthcare.
